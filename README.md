# Detailed delineation of the fetal brain in diffusion MRI via multi-task learning

This repository will host the code and trained models for detailed delineation of the fetal brain directly in the diffusion MRI space.

The model can compute (1) Segmentation of the brain tissue, (2) Delineation of 60 distinct white matter tracts, and (3) Parcellation.

The paper describing the method is here https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.29.609697v1

Tensorflow models are available here https://tinyurl.com/w4rs8js7
